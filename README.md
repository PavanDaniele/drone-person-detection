# drone-person-detection
In this project we plan to equip the UAV with a Jetson Nano and a small camera.
The system should be able to detect lost people from a reasonable altitude by training a model that is compact enough to fit the Jetson. To do this, we will start with a dataset of people as seen by a drone (zenit view), which will be used to train the model.The main objective is to develop a model that is compact enough to run on the Jetson Nano.
The project includes real flight test to validate the proposed solution, and system performance analysis.
